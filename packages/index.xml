Each package provides specific functionality for building and managing Kubernetes resources.
Core Packages Launcher The launcher package provides a package system for creating reusable, customizable Kubernetes applications without the complexity of templating engines. It uses a declarative patch-based approach to customize base Kubernetes manifests.
Patch The patch package implements a JSONPath-based declarative patching system. It allows you to modify Kubernetes resources using a simple, powerful patch language that maintains YAML structure and comments.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://www.gokure.dev/packages/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/><item><title>Launcher</title><link>https://www.gokure.dev/packages/launcher/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gokure.dev/packages/launcher/index.html</guid><description>Launcher Package The launcher package (formerly kurel) provides a package system for creating reusable, customizable Kubernetes applications without the complexity of templating engines.

Hierarchy The stack organizes resources in a four-level hierarchy:
Cluster — Top-level grouping representing a Kubernetes cluster Node — Logical grouping within a cluster (e.g., infrastructure, applications) Bundle — Collection of related applications Application — Individual Kubernetes application with its resources This structure maps naturally to directory layouts consumed by GitOps tools like Flux and ArgoCD.</description></item><item><title>Layout</title><link>https://www.gokure.dev/packages/layout/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gokure.dev/packages/layout/index.html</guid><description>Layout Package The layout package handles manifest organization and directory structure generation. It transforms Kure’s in-memory stack representation into organized directory structures with proper kustomization.yaml files that GitOps tools can consume.
See the detailed documentation for the full layout system reference.

It acts as a thin wrapper around sigs.k8s.io/yaml and the Kubernetes runtime scheme from client-go.
YAML Helpers Basic marshalling and unmarshalling is performed through Marshal and Unmarshal functions which operate on the standard io.Reader and io.Writer interfaces. For persisting data to disk, SaveFile and LoadFile helpers wrap file creation and reading.
For in-memory operations the Buffer type implements both io.Reader and io.Writer and exposes Marshal and Unmarshal methods.</description></item><item><title>Errors</title><link>https://www.gokure.dev/packages/errors/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gokure.dev/packages/errors/index.html</guid><description>Errors Package The errors package provides structured error types and handling utilities for the Kure library and kurel tool.
Error Types The package provides several specialized error constructors:
ResourceValidationError — Validation failures for Kubernetes resources, including kind, name, and field information FileError — File operation failures (read, write, parse) with operation type and path ValidationError — General validation failures with field details ConfigurationError — Configuration-related errors Predefined Errors Common validation errors are predefined for efficiency and consistency:</description></item><item><title>CLI</title><link>https://www.gokure.dev/packages/cli/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gokure.dev/packages/cli/index.html</guid><description>CLI Package The cli package provides shared utilities and abstractions for building command-line interfaces in the Kure and kurel tools.
Components Factory — Dependency injection container for CLI commands, making them easier to test and configure IOStreams — Abstraction for stdin/stdout/stderr, enabling testable commands Printer — Output formatting supporting YAML, JSON, table, wide, and name formats (compatible with kubectl conventions) Config — Configuration file handling with merging from defaults, config files, environment variables, and flags API Reference pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-kure/kure/pkg/cli</description></item></channel></rss>
