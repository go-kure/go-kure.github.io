It acts as a thin wrapper around sigs.k8s.io/yaml and the Kubernetes runtime scheme from client-go.
YAML Helpers Basic marshalling and unmarshalling is performed through Marshal and Unmarshal functions which operate on the standard io.Reader and io.Writer interfaces. For persisting data to disk, SaveFile and LoadFile helpers wrap file creation and reading.
For in-memory operations the Buffer type implements both io.Reader and io.Writer and exposes Marshal and Unmarshal methods.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://www.gokure.dev/packages/io/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
